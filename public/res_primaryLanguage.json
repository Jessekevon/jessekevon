      "description": "The intersection of technology and physical experiences has always fascinated me. I consider myself incredibly lucky to have grown up at a crossroads of technology. I was fortunate enough to have a childhood filled with bike rides, soccer games, imaginative play, tree-climbing, and adventures in the woods behind my house. Back then, my only technology was a Nintendo on a blocky CRT TV, and even then, it was beautiful in its simplicity. However, with the advent of the internet, everything changed. I can still recall the exhilarating feeling of logging onto AIM after dinner to chat with my friends, a feeling that was only surpassed by the arrival of the iPhone in my 20s.The beautiful marriage of analog and digital has been my passion, and I take pride in providing tailored solutions to clients that help them achieve their goals.   By being in the middle of this intersection between technology and tangible physical skills, I am able to create innovative and unique solutions that bring together the best of both worlds.   I believe that technology has the power to enhance our physical experiences, and I am thrilled to be a part of this exciting era where anything is possible.",
